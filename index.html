        <h1>About</h1>
        A.P.J. Abdul Kalam(15 October 1931-27 July 2015) wasthe 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. A career
        scientist turned statesman, Kalamwas
        born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, and studied physics and aerospaceengineering. He spent the next four
        decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainlyat the Defence Research and Development Organisation
        (DRDO) and Indian Space

        Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian spaceprogramme and military missile
        development efforts.

        He thus came to be known as

        the
        Missile Man of India
        for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launchvehicle technology.
        He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role inIndia's
        Pokhran-II
        nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in

        1974

            </div>
            <div class="cardDesc">
                In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright andhardworking student who
                had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies,especially mathematics.

                After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher SecondarySchool, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to
                attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli,

                then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in1954.

                He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of

                Technology.

                While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied

                with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project wasfinished within
                the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who latersaid to him, "I was putting
                you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline".

                He

                narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth inqualifiers, and
                only eight positions were available in the IAF.

                <p> Kalam started his career by designing a small helicopter for the Indian Army, butremained
                    unconvinced with the choice of his job at DRDO.

                </p>
                <p> Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, therenowned space
                    scientist. In 1969, Kalam was transferred to theIndian Space ResearchOrganization (ISRO) where he
                    was the project director of India's first indigenous SatelliteLaunch Vehicle (SLV-III) which
                    successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near earthorbit in July 1980</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, namely, Project Devil and Project Valiant , which sought
                to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLVprogramme. Despite the
                disapproval of Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhiallotted secret funds for these aerospace
                projects through her discretionary powers underKalam's directorship.Kalam played an integral role
                convincing the Union Cabinet toconceal the true nature of these classified aerospace projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni,an intermediate
                range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile,although the projects have
                been criticised for mismanagement and cost and timeoverruns
            </p>
            <p>
                The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during this period where he played anintensive political and
                technological role. Kalam served as the Chief Project Coordinator,along with R. Chidambaram during the
                testing phase.
